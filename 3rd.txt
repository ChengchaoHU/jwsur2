Susan,

You and Brian both had asked about a 3rd edition of Java Web Services: Up and Running. I don't
see any huge changes, as the web services landscape has not changed drastically since the 2nd edition.
The changes from the 1st to the 2nd editions were more dramatic.

Here's my short list. Feedback from elsewhere would be very useful, of course. 

# Incorporate the functional programming and stream innovations of Java 8 into the examples, perhaps
  with new examples that better illustrate these new APIs.

# More emphasis on RESTful services and social media sites:

  -- Full example involving a RESTful client against Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn.
     Probably Facebook, as there are some good 3rd-party libraries out there.

# Drop the coverage of Restlet in favor of Spring MVC.

# Expand the coverage of JAX-RS with an additional example or two.

# Drop most of the Java EE material, but maintain the TomEE for coverage of how
  a @Stateless Session EJB is thereby a SOAP-based service.

# Change the .Net/Java interoperability example, on the .Net side, to the WebAPI.
